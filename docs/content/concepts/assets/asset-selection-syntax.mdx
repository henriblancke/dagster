# Asset Selection Syntax

To specify an asset selection, Dagster supports a simple query syntax. This selection syntax is accepted in a few different places:
- The `list` and `materialize` commands in the [asset command-line interface](/_apidocs/cli#dagster-asset).
- The asset filter text box on the asset graph page, in the UI.
- The `selection` parameter of <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />.


It works as follows:

- A query includes a list of clauses. Clauses are separated by commas, except in the case of the `selection` parameter of <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />, where each clause is a separate element in a list.
- A clause can be an asset key, in which case that asset is selected.
- An asset key with multiple components can be specified by inserting slashes between the components.
- A clause can be an asset key preceded by `*`, in which case that asset and all of its ancestors (upstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be an asset key followed by `*`, in which case that asset and all of its descendents (downstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be an asset key followed by any number of `+`s, in which case that asset and descendents up to that many hops away are selected.
- A clause can be an asset key preceded by any number of `+`s, in which case that asset and ancestors up to that many hops away are selected.

**Clause examples**

- `some_asset`: select "some_asset" itself
- `my/prefixed/asset`: select the asset whose <PyObject object="AssetKey"/> in Python is `AssetKey(["my", "prefixed", "asset"])`
- `*some_asset`: select "some_asset" and all ancestors (upstream dependencies).
- `some_asset*`: select "some_asset" and all descendants (downstream dependencies).
- `*some_asset*`: select "some_asset" and all of its ancestors and descendants.
- `+some_asset`: select "some_asset" and its direct parents.
- `some_asset+++`: select "some_asset" and its children, its children's children, and its children's children's children.
